This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in VBScript where a function exits prematurely when an empty string is passed as a parameter. The issue lies in the `Exit Function` statement within the `If` block. This behavior is not always consistent and may occur intermittently.  The solution provided addresses this issue by modifying the function's logic to ensure proper handling of empty strings.
